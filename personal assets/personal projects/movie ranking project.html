<h1>TOP 3 OF THE BEST WAR FILMS EVER MADE (ACCORDING TO CRITICS AND AUDIENCES)</h1>

<hr />

<p>Choosing the "best" war films can be subjective, as people have different preferences and criteria for what makes a film great. 
However, as of my last knowledge update in September 2021, here are three widely acclaimed war films:</p>

<h2>1. Saving Private Ryan (1998)</h2>
<p>Directed by Steven Spielberg, this film is known for its intense and realistic portrayal of the D-Day invasion during World War II. 
It follows a group of soldiers led by Captain John Miller (Tom Hanks) as they search for a paratrooper, Private James Ryan (Matt Damon), who is the last surviving brother of four.</p>

<h2>2. Apocalypse Now (1979)</h2>
<p>Directed by Francis Ford Coppola, this film is a loose adaptation of Joseph Conrad's novella "Heart of Darkness" and is set during the Vietnam War. 
It follows Captain Willard (Martin Sheen) as he travels up the Nung River to assassinate Colonel Kurtz (Marlon Brando), a renegade Special Forces officer.</p>

<h2>3. Full Metal Jacket (1987)</h2>
<p>Another film set during the Vietnam War, directed by Stanley Kubrick, "Full Metal Jacket" explores the experiences of a group of U.S. 
Marine Corps recruits through their basic training and their deployment in Vietnam. It's known for its gritty portrayal of war and its impact on soldiers.</p>

<p>Keep in mind that there are many excellent war films covering various conflicts and perspectives. 
New films may have been released since my last update, so it's worth checking for more recent recommendations.</p>
